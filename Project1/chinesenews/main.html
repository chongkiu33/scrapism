    </div> 
    <div class="news_content">
        <p> China and Vietnam have agreed to consolidate their traditional friendship, strengthen the strategic communication between them, enhance political mutual trust and properly handle their differences in order to constantly take their comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership in the new era to a new level.<br>
During their talks on Monday at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, and Nguyen Phu Trong, general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee, vowed to not allow anyone, any forces or the South China Sea issue to undermine the ties between the two parties and the two countries.<br>
Trong, who started his three-day official visit to China on Sunday, is the first foreign leader Xi has received since the conclusion of the 20th CPC National Congress, which elected the 20th CPC Central Committee with Xi at the core.<br>
Xi, who is also China's president, briefed the Vietnamese leader about the 20th CPC National Congress. He said that the two parties should seek happiness for the people and progress for humanity and jointly cope with the complex international environment and grave risks and challenges.

            <p> 
                Steering China-US ties back on track and keeping collaboration afloat were high on the agenda of the latest talks between the two countries' senior diplomats on Monday, which analysts said showed that both sides are aware of the consequences of the tense, frayed ties.<br>
                They made the observation after State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi had a phone conversation on Monday with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken over China-US ties.
                It was the highest level of diplomatic talks on the relations since the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held last month.<br>
                The ties between the world's two largest economies saw tension soaring this year after provocative visits to Taiwan by US lawmakers and hostile moves by the US that targeted China in various areas.<br>

                In its 22 years, the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation has facilitated the progress of Africa in many fields including trade, economy, infrastructure development and industrialization. The FOCAC's successes can be seen in the shared benefits and the most-talked-about South-South diplomatic engagement.<br>
                According to World Bank data, China has sustained its efforts to boost Africa's industrialization process, contributing on average 12 percent to its industrial production or manufacturing as of 2017.<br>
                Between 2010 and 2019, China was the biggest employment generator in Africa, creating on average 18,600 direct jobs per year, much more than the 12,000 jobs created by the United States per year during the same period. And creating jobs is the best way of alleviating poverty and promoting the growth of African countries.<br>
Between the years 2000 and 2012, China officially introduced 21 development finance projects in Malawi alone, with the projects ranging from a $70 million grant to build the Karonga-Chitipa Highway linking Malawi with neighboring Zambia in 2008 to the $80 million loan from the Export-Import Bank of China to build a science and technology university.<br>

        <div class="news_content">
            <p> Traditional Chinese Medicine, or TCM, is being used increasingly in the United States to cure modern problems resulting from stress caused by political and social upheaval, including the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>
                The practice, which is more than 2,000 years old, dates to the shamanistic era of the Shang Dynasty (c.16th century-11th century BC).<br>
                TCM includes acupuncture, cupping, pain moxibustion (a form of heat therapy), herbal medicine, nutrition, tuina massage (used with modern medical techniques to treat a range of conditions), and exercise such as tai chi and qigong, which combine movement and meditation.<br>
                It is used to treat arthritis, back, neck and knee pain, gastrointestinal disorders, high blood pressure, stress, anxiety, infertility and many other medical problems.<br>
                In the heart of New York City's Chinatown, patients head to the second floor of a nondescript building, passing businesses where dressmakers create traditional qipao gowns, and other premises where kung fu is practiced.<br>

            <p> Founder of nonprofit says people are now more open and accepting of those battling the illness. Wang Xiaoyu reports.<br>
                Editor's note: To mark the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China Daily is producing 10 profile stories to show the changes in the subjects' fields in the past decade. This is the seventh in the series.<br>
                During Bu Jiaqing's junior year in college, a friend let him in on the secret that he had tested positive for HIV and needed Bu's help.<br>
                "At the time (2008), I had already been trained in HIV prevention techniques as a Red Cross volunteer, but knowing that someone so close to me had been infected still came as a shock," Bu said. "After calming down, I helped him contact the disease control authorities and local Red Cross officials for consultation and treatment."<br>
                The incident prompted Bu to reflect on the dilemma facing China's HIV community. "Even as a trained 'social worker', I had a moment of distress. I thought 'What about those who are newly infected but have no idea of the support they can access?'"<br>

            <p> An 84-year-old man from the small city of Zigong in Sichuan province has become an unlikely social media sensation after his granddaughter quit her job and set out to help him realize some of his wishes on his bucket list, attracting hundreds of millions of views online.
                The short videos posted to Douyin — the Chinese version of TikTok — show 25-year-old Wan Minghui, who goes by the name Little Wan on social media, taking her grandfather to visit Beijing in September, a long-cherished wish of him and his wife before she passed away six years ago.<br>
                The elderly man was interested in many things on his journey, from the number of tunnels to how spacious the airport was.<br>
                He can be seen in the videos leaving their hotel in Beijing at 2 am to attend the national flag-raising ceremony and waiting patiently in a long line. Clutching a photo of his wife, Wan's grandfather sang the national anthem and wiped away tears.<br>
                At some bucket list destinations in Beijing, he was photographed with his wife's picture, which he brought along to make it feel as though she were traveling with him. Many touched netizens commented that his smile revealed his inner feelings.<br>
                The videos under the hashtags "Fulfilling Grandpa's 100 Wishes "and "Taking Grandpa for Travel "have been viewed more than 100 million times, receiving more than five million likes and a long list of comments, including praise for Little Wan, best wishes for her grandfather and discussions about the meaning of life.<br>

                The team was established in 2018 in an institutional reshuffle of the State Council, the country's Cabinet. On Nov 9 that year, President Xi Jinping conferred the flag to the team, ordering them to be loyal to the Party, disciplined and devoted to the people.<br>

        </div> 
        <div class="news_content">
            <p> China handled more freight via railway and built more rail lines in the first three quarters of the year, the national railway operator China State Railway Group said on Monday.
                From January to September, the national railway network handled 2.91 billion metric tons of cargo, a year-on-year increase of 6.3 percent.<br>
                Coal made up the bulk of that cargo — about 1.1 billion tons, up 17 percent year-on-year.
                A total of 12,000 freight train services were operated between China and Europe during that period, a 7 percent increase year-on-year. The trains carried a total of 1.18 million cargo containers, up 8 percent year-on-year.<br>
                A total of 555,000 cargo containers were transported via rail-sea intermodal trips along the New Western Land-Sea Trade Corridor, a year-on-year growth of 22 percent.<br>
                In addition, more railway lines were opened and more investment was made in railway construction to help stabilize the economy.<br>
                During the first three quarters, China invested 475 billion yuan ($65 billion) in railway fixed assets. About 238 billion yuan was spent in remote and poor areas.<br>
                At the same time, several new railway lines with a total length of 2,381 kilometers were opened, 1,198 km of which were designated for high-speed trains.<br>

                    <p > There was little doubt about who would emerge ascendant from the 20th Party Congress. Nonetheless, the numerous profiles written on the man over the past week reinforce just how much power Xi Jinping has managed to accumulate as he segues into his third term as General Secretary of the CCP. Shunting his predecessor offstage, shutting women out of the Politburo, and gearing up for greater confrontation around the world, Xi reminded his domestic and international audiences that he is firmly in command of the CCP, with all of the risks and rewards that entails.<br>
                        Throughout Xi’s rise and rule, he has maneuvered his way into becoming arguably the most powerful person in the world. Reporting on Xi’s evolution “from ‘counter-revolutionary’ to absolute power,” Verna Yu and Emma Graham-Harrison from The Guardian described Xi’s infatuation with control:....<br>

                    <p >In his landmark political report before the 20th Party Congress, Xi Jinping hailed China’s “tenacious pursuit” of its dynamic zero-COVID policy, an indication the policy is here to stay, despite consistent domestic criticism. At The Washington Post, Lily Kuo reported on the Chinese government’s continued embrace of the policy: <br>
                        For three consecutive days this week, the party mouthpiece People’s Daily published editorials on why it must be followed.<br>
                        “Fighting against the epidemic is both a material struggle and a spiritual confrontation. It is a contest of strength and a contest of will. We will not waver,” a commentary exhorted on Tuesday.<br>
                        […] The policy is “a key marker of Xi’s ability to lead the country through crisis. Its success is inextricably bound with that of Xi’s rule,” said Diana Fu, an associate professor in political science at the University of Toronto.<br>

                    <p> The leadership changes following the 20th Party Congress not only entrench Xi Jinping’s power at home, but also solidify his vision for China’s engagements abroad. Official rhetoric in and around the Congress points to a continuation of the CCP’s assertive and increasingly aggressive international posture, exemplified by officials’ notorious “wolf-warrior diplomacy.” With Xi calling the shots on the Chinese side and no one daring to dispute, the West braces for more confrontation with Beijing.<br>
                        Xi’s desire to further project China’s power abroad was a clear theme of the Congress. One of the “Five Firm Grasps”—a new buzzword meant to summarize the “spirit” of the Congress—emphasizes Xi Jinping Thought as a “world view.” The phrase suggests that Xi’s thought has global relevance, and as China Media Project stated, it “sends the additional message that the general secretary’s ideas are a formula, a toolbox, that should be used to grapple with the challenges in the decade to come — whether in China or in the world.” Tuvia Gering’s latest Discourse Power newsletter highlighted Xi’s vision for China’s global influence as expressed in his work report to the 20th Party Congress:<br>
                        “We must accelerate the development of Chinese discourse and narrative systems, effectively communicate the voice of China, and portray a credible, lovable, and respectable image of the country. <br>

                    <p> Following one man’s daring political protest against Xi Jinping’s continued rule and harsh zero-COVID policies on the eve of China’s 20th Communist Party Congress, citizens and activists have launched a poster campaign in solidarity with the protester’s demands. Due to heavy censorship of protest-related text, video, and images on Chinese social media, much of the protest art is being shared via Telegram, Twitter, and other social media outside the Great Firewall, and via Apple’s local wireless file sharing feature AirDrop within it. Chinese students abroad have joined in as well, posting handwritten signs and posters at a variety of university campuses around the world.<br>
                        While the posters display creativity and variety, many quote directly from the two banners displayed by the protester on Beijing’s Sitong Bridge on October 13. One banner read, “We want food, not nucleic acid tests / Freedom, not lockdowns / Dignity, not lies / Reform, not Cultural Revolution / Elections, not rulers / To be citizens, not slaves.” The other banner exhorted, “Boycott classes. Boycott work. Depose the traitorous despot Xi Jinping.”<br>

                    <p> A Sichuan city’s adoption of Yuan Dynasty-style community policing has inspired fears of a return to the despotism of yore. Zigong is the latest municipality to launch a trial of the shihuzhang, or “ten-household captain system,” in which a “captain” assumes responsibility for the governance of ten neighboring households. The shihuzhang system was first adopted during the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368 C.E.), but its roots date back even earlier, to the Spring and Autumn Period (ca. 770-475 B.C.E.). Zigong is not the first locale to implement a shihuzhang system in contemporary China. Zigong’s neighboring city Neijiang, Fujian’s Wenzhou, Yunnan’s provincial capital Kunming, and Xinjiang all have similar programs. Infographics published by a Neijiang government WeChat account indicate that captains are primarily responsible for enforcing the “routinization” of China’s zero-COVID policy by publicizing it, tracking returning migrant workers, and scanning and reporting residents’ health codes and travel histories. During lockdowns, captains are expected to “calm and reassure” their neighbors, deliver groceries, and monitor compliance with home quarantine. Captains are further tasked with mediating minor conflicts, keeping an eye out for security risks, and collecting suggestions to pass on to higher-level cadres. Unlike the community volunteers deployed to “mobilize the masses” (identified by political scientist Lynette Ong), shihuzhang captains are explicitly tied to the Party system: they are a grassroots extension of the “five-level organization system” headed by street-level Party committees. Online reactions to the reinstitution of shihuzhang were largely negative, with a number of commenters viewing it as a sign of political regression:

                    <p> A violent confrontation between protesters and Chinese consular staff in the U.K. highlights China’s increasing determination to police beyond its borders, and tests the resolve of Western governments to maintain their sovereignty. On Sunday, a group of several dozen protesters led by the NGO Hong Kong Indigenous Defense Force gathered outside of the Chinese consulate in Manchester, U.K., on the opening day of the CCP’s 20th Party Congress. According to Manchester police, video footage, and various witnesses, Chinese consular staff emerged from the gate of the consulate, vandalized large posters displayed by the protesters, and attempted to take a poster satirizing Xi Jinping back into the consulate. During the ensuing scuffle that broke out to prevent the theft, one protester was dragged into the consulate and beaten by consular staff.

                        On Saturday, October 22, Xi Jinping’s predecessor Hu Jintao was unceremoniously escorted out of the closing of the 20th Party Congress in front of the domestic and international press. Hu’s highly unusual exit, a major departure from the strict political choreography characteristic of Party Congresses past, left observers across the world questioning what, exactly, had happened. In an English-language tweet, official state news agency Xinhua claimed: “When he [Hu Jintao] was not feeling well during the session, his staff, for his health, accompanied him to a room next to the meeting venue for a rest. Now, he is much better.” There was no accompanying Chinese-language report and no other Chinese outlets ran pieces on Hu’s removal. China Central Television, the state-run broadcaster, included a clip of Hu attending the Party Congress in an evening broadcast but did not mention his exit. CDT has re-published a video, in Chinese, from Singapore’s CNA (Channel NewsAsia) showing the circumstances of his exit:
